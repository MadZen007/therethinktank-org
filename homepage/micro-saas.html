                        Let's face it. You didn't start your business to spend all day on tedious tasks, right? You had a DREAM. A passion. A vision. But now... you're drowning in paperwork, marketing, admin, and all the other stuff that sucks the life out of you.

                        I get it. REALLY get it. There are just some things that HAVE to be done... but NOBODY wants to do them.

                        We're building a catalog of automations designed to rescue solo and small business owners from the daily grind. We're talking about automating the tasks that make you want to scream... the ones that eat up your time and energy and prevent you from focusing on what REALLY matters: Growing your business and living your life.

                        <li>No More: Looking for new leads.</li>
                        <li>No More: Wasting hours on social media posts, and marketing.</li>
                        <li>No More: Chasing late invoices.</li>
                        <li>No More: Staying up late trying to figure out what the competition is charging, or doing different.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="copy-text">
                        Our automations are designed to be simple, affordable, and effective. Think of us as your virtual assistant... without the hefty price tag. One simple monthly cost to have full access to ALL of the automations we have (and will keep adding). We take care of the tasks you HATE so you can focus on the things you LOVE.
